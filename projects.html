		<ul class = "projectInfo"> 
			<li> A deterministic pushdown automata (DPDA) accepts deterministic context - free languages -  where there will be at most one transition from any state based on the input given. </li>
			<li> The goal of this project is to design and implement a deterministic push - down automata that can recognize a specific context free language L. </li>
			<li> L is defined as L = {a^nb^n | n >= 0}. To put this into simpler terms, the language has to have an equal number of a’s and b’s where the a’s must come first before the b’s. </li>

		</p>

		<p class = "projectLang"> Python language </p>

		<ul class = "projectInfo"> 
			<li> The final deliverable’s main goal is to create a student query tool, which is a flexible program that can read a file and output different results based on a set menu. </li>
			<li> The menu will give the user options to choose from such as, viewing the entire student record, students whose last names begin with a certain string, and students who are graduating in a certain year. </li>
